## Why this rule exists

A module that exposes a mutating route is a write surface, so its declared policy must gate writes at or above the read tier — otherwise anyone who can read can also mutate (privilege inversion). Two shapes are caught statically: the write tier set to the read floor, and a default-ladder inversion where the write rank is below the read rank (including a raised read tier whose write tier is left at the lower default). The framework's default policy is the safe shape. A custom role ladder's ranks are not knowable from a source scan, so those are enforced by the boot-time check — this rule is the early-warning build-time half. A public module is governed by public_modules_are_read_only instead. The check is tied to the policy bound in the module's manifest.

## What to do instead

Policy(write=Roles.VIEWER), Policy.tiers(write=...) at the read floor, and default-ladder inversions like Policy(read=Roles.ADMIN, write=Roles.EDITOR) are refused; Policy.default() is the safe shape, and create_app -> _validate_policy_write_tiers covers custom ladders at boot. (reference stack; another stack ships its own realisation.)

## If you really need an exception

Add a justified marker on (or immediately above) the line, and record it
in your app's escape-hatch budget:

```
# arch-allow-mutations-require-write-role: <reason>
```

An unjustified marker is itself a violation, and marker counts must
exactly match the checked-in budget (which can only shrink).

## Enforcement

- Checked while the app runs? Yes — the framework also enforces this while the app runs (fail closed).
- `build-time`: `terp.arch` — `check_mutations_require_write_role`
- `runtime`: `terp.core` — `build_guard`
- `runtime`: `terp.core` — `_validate_policy_write_tiers`
