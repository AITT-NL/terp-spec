## Why this rule exists

This makes tenant isolation structural on the write side: reads of a tenant-scoped model are already filtered centrally by the registered tenant scope predicate, but the tenant-scoped service base is what stamps the tenant on create — so a plain service (which would insert an unstamped, never-visible row) is rejected at build time.

## What to do instead

A TenantScopedMixin model's service extends TenantScopedService (stamps tenant_id on create, ADR 0017); a plain BaseService is refused. (reference stack; another stack ships its own realisation.)

## If you really need an exception

Add a justified marker on (or immediately above) the line, and record it
in your app's escape-hatch budget:

```
# arch-allow-tenant-scoped-models-use-scoped-service: <reason>
```

An unjustified marker is itself a violation, and marker counts must
exactly match the checked-in budget (which can only shrink).

## Enforcement

- Checked while the app runs? No — this is a property of the written source only; the build-time check is the control, by recorded decision.
- `build-time`: `terp.arch` — `check_tenant_scoped_models_use_scoped_service`
