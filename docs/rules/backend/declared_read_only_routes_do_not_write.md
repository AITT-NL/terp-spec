## Why this rule exists

Write authority is derived from the HTTP method, which is right for almost every route and blind to one: the handler that uses an unsafe method because its input is a body, not because it writes — validating a candidate document, previewing an import, costing a plan. Undeclared, such a route is pure only by the absence of a write: a guarantee made of missing code, which holds until an edit adds a line and which no rule and no reviewer is prompted to check. Declaring the intent makes it enforceable in both layers: the build-time rule refuses a declared handler that calls a mutating service method, and the runtime binder marks the request read-only so the write chokepoint refuses a write the rule cannot see statically (through a helper, a subscriber, a capability). Fix a violation by removing the write — putting it behind its own route — or by removing the declaration, whichever the route was meant to be; never both, because a declared handler that writes leaves the platform holding two answers to the same promise. Authorization is deliberately unchanged: a declared route is still authorized at the write tier, because declaring purity narrows what the handler may do, never what the caller must hold.

## What to do instead

Mutating BaseService calls (create/update/delete/_save/_remove) inside a handler decorated with terp.core.read_only are flagged; create_app binds a declared route's request read-only (build_read_only_request_binder). (reference stack; another stack ships its own realisation.)

## If you really need an exception

Add a justified marker on (or immediately above) the line, and record it
in your app's escape-hatch budget:

```
# arch-allow-declared-read-only-routes-do-not-write: <reason>
```

An unjustified marker is itself a violation, and marker counts must
exactly match the checked-in budget (which can only shrink).

## Enforcement

- Checked while the app runs? Yes — the framework also enforces this while the app runs (fail closed).
- `build-time`: `terp.arch` — `check_declared_read_only_routes_do_not_write`
- `runtime`: `terp.core` — `build_read_only_request_binder`
