# `backend/no_raw_outbound_http`

**App modules do not import raw HTTP clients; outbound calls use a capability**

## Why this rule exists

Directly importing an HTTP client library — or the lower-level socket / protocol primitives that reach the same network — makes SSRF protection, allowlists, egress auditing, and timeout policy a per-call-site choice. Outbound traffic belongs behind a declared capability that centralizes those controls. As a security rule this also scans test and migration files inside a module — they are importable code, so they are application surface too.

## What to do instead

httpx / requests / urllib.request / urllib3 / aiohttp imports and the socket / http.client escape routes are refused in app modules; outbound calls go through a declared egress capability. (reference stack; another stack ships its own realisation.)

## If you really need an exception

Add a justified marker on (or immediately above) the line, and record it
in your app's escape-hatch budget:

```
# arch-allow-no-raw-outbound-http: <reason>
```

An unjustified marker is itself a violation, and marker counts must
exactly match the checked-in budget (which can only shrink).

## Enforcement

- Checked while the app runs? No — this is a property of the written source only; the build-time check is the control, by recorded decision.
- `build-time`: `terp.arch` — `check_no_raw_outbound_http`
