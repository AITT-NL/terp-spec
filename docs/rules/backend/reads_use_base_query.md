# `backend/reads_use_base_query`

**A scope-trait model is read through the composed scoped query, never a raw query built from scratch**

## Why this rule exists

A model that mixes a soft-delete or tenant-scope trait carries row scope. A bespoke read that queries the model directly — instead of building on the composed scoped query — drops that scope, leaking soft-deleted or cross-tenant rows (closing the composition point to overrides did not close a new read method that never calls it). Build reads on the scoped query and the declared filter seam; the request session re-applies the scope to single-entity reads as the runtime backstop, and this rule is the build-time early warning. The one sanctioned raw query — the scoped composition point itself — lives in the framework, not a module, so it is never scanned here.

## What to do instead

select(Model) on a SoftDeleteMixin / TenantScopedMixin model is refused in modules (ADR 0017, F1); build on base_query() / business_filters(), with apply_row_scope as the runtime backstop. (reference stack; another stack ships its own realisation.)

## If you really need an exception

Add a justified marker on (or immediately above) the line, and record it
in your app's escape-hatch budget:

```
# arch-allow-reads-use-base-query: <reason>
```

An unjustified marker is itself a violation, and marker counts must
exactly match the checked-in budget (which can only shrink).

## Enforcement

- Checked while the app runs? Yes — the framework also enforces this while the app runs (fail closed).
- `build-time`: `terp.arch` — `check_reads_use_base_query`
- `runtime`: `terp.core` — `apply_row_scope`
